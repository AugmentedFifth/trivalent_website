          <p>
            Trivalent is a musical solo project that happens to be based out of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon">PDX</a>.
            Trivalent is a personal musical outlet and a way to explore sounds
            and musical composition.

          <h2>etymology</h2>

          <p>
            The origin of the name &ldquo;Trivalent&rdquo; is in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic"
              >three-valued logic</a
            >, otherwise known as <strong>trivalent</strong> logic, to
            distinguish it from bivalent logics like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic"
              >classical logic</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_logic"
              >intuitionistic logic</a
            >.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              See Kleene&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Notation for Ordinal Numbers&rdquo;
              [1938] (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/2267778"
                >doi:10.2307/2267778</a
              >) for the origin of the strong logic of indeterminacy.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            The name does not refer to any particular axiomatization of a
            trivalent logic, although the usual suspects are
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene"
              >Kleene&rsquo;s</a
            >
            strong logic of indeterminacy and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81ukasiewicz_logic"
              >&#x141;ukasiewicz logic</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trivalent logics are not necessarily interesting from a logical
            point of view (modern treatments of logic are largely
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure"

              >categorical</a
            >, and/or arise from

              >the geometry of proof nets and things like that</a
            >), but they are
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan_algebra#Kleene_algebra"
              ><em>somewhat</em> algebraically interesting</a
            >, and more importantly for this purpose, are philosophically
            interesting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Intuitionistic logic (a bivalent logic, to be sure) is &mdash; at
            least when equipped with its usual
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer%E2%80%93Heyting%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_interpretation"
              >BHK interpretation</a
            >
            &mdash; a kind of crypto-trivalent logic, because it says nothing
            about propositions of which we have no proof nor any proof of their
            negation. Similarly, ordinary reasoning is often trivalent: we know
            things, we know not-things, and we don&rsquo;t know things.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information"
              >Partial information</a
            >, indeterminacy, and the unknown are all things that we have to
            deal with frequently.
