      <h2>what is Trivalent?</h2>

      <p>Trivalent is the product of a roughly 9-year <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> between the
      long-belligerent countries of &Agrave;place and An&ouml;therplace.
      Although relations between &Agrave;place and An&ouml;therplace have since
      worsened, some of the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph">phonograph</a> records
      produced during that time have been recovered in a usable state.</p>

      <h2>no, really, what is Trivalent?</h2>

      <p>Trivalent is the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinisation_of_names">latinized</a>
      name for an intentionally obfuscated collection of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroacoustic_music">electroacoustic</a>
      artifacts produced by an intellectual
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society">secret society</a>
      consisting of an unknown number of students at the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_Institute_of_Technology">Harbin
      Institute of Technology</a> in <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heilongjiang">Heilongjiang</a> in
      1970. Although it has been speculated that Trivalent was obfuscated for
      the purpose of bypassing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_censorship">national
      censors</a>, Trivalent was nonetheless censored quite early on, and was
      only rediscovered recently.</p>
